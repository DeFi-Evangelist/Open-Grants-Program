## Project Overview :page_facing_up: 

### Overview
  
We're [team](https://venlab.dev/) of founders and core devs of tokenless oracles protocol - [Gravity](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.00966.pdf). The protocol itself is aiming to be a blockchain-agnostic solution. [Graviton](https://graviton.one/) - is an application on top of gravity network designed to increase user experience with wrapped tokens, gateways and bring an incentivisation for gateways oracles and AMM liquidity providers in the target chains.

Gravity is using tendermint as a framework for a tokenless internal ledger designed to be a message bus, events log distributed storage and consensus engine for oracle transactions (commit/reveal/aggregations and reputation changes).

The team is looking for approaches to add an integration with polkadot/parity tech and expand/develop products within the polkadot ecosystem.

### Reason for an application and an ecosystem fit
There are many existing tendermint based chains are already in production. To scale their potential within the polkadot ecosystem and also to bring more integrations and products from already established teams we have to use Low-Trust Tendermint-Polka Bridges.

This is also the most popular issue in [Feedback Parity Portal](https://feedback.parity.io/b/substrate-feedback-board/low-trust-tendermint-bridge/) at the moment.

Our open-sourced implementation of a Tendermint bridge will be used by our [gravity](https://gravity.tech/) team and another [teams](https://cosmos.network/ecosystem) who has an infrastructure on Tendermint and Cosmos-SDK.

We believe in "cooperation over competition" principle and we're going to make a first move in that direction.
